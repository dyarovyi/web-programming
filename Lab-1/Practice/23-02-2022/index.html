            <p>
                <b>HTML5</b> is a markup language used for <i>structuring</i> and <em>presenting</em> content on the <abbr title="World Wide Web">www</abbr>. It is the fifth and last[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft). HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, <sup>[2]</sup> with a <strong>update</strong> and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[4][5] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[6] HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[7] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

We’ve watched it change purely text based websites to adding pictures, including videos and have attempted to make websites more interactive and aesthetically pleasing. Behind all websites and web-applications across sizes is a team of web designers and developers who are tasked with making sure that a website is both aesthetically appealing and functional. These days web-developers need to account for multiple factors when building websites, search engines and how websites are indexed, how the website needs to load on mobile devices and account for devices of different sizes when designing web-based experiences. Just like having the ability to speak a foreign language, equipping yourself with basic HTML and CSS skills are helpful in almost all professions. These powerful coding languages are not only helpful to web developers but in any professional setting, basic knowledge of these languages could make a huge difference to you and your resume.
